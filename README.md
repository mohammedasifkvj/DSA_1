## Data Structures

### Array
- Basic operations on arrays, such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- Includes examples of sorting, filtering, and other common array methods.

### Object
- Explanation of object creation, key-value storage, and basic operations.
- Examples of manipulating objects and accessing properties.

### String
- Covers string manipulations, including common methods such as slicing, searching, and concatenation.
- Example of reversing a string and other string transformations.

### Map
- Demonstrates how to use JavaScript's `Map` object for efficient key-value storage.
- Examples of adding, retrieving, and deleting elements from a map.

### Set
- Implementation of JavaScript's `Set` for storing unique values.
- Examples of adding, checking, and deleting elements from a set.

### Linked List
- Basic implementation of a singly linked list with operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

## Algorithms

### Searching Algorithms

#### Binary Search
- A function that performs binary search on a sorted array.
- Efficient for large datasets as it has a time complexity of O(log n).

#### Linear Search
- A simple linear search algorithm for unsorted arrays.
- Good for smaller datasets as it has a time complexity of O(n).

### Other Patterns and Series

#### Star Patterns
- Includes different star pattern programs, such as pyramids, triangles, and diamonds.
- A great way to practice looping and nested loops.

#### Fibonacci Series
- Generates a Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms.
- Includes both recursive and iterative solutions.

#### Factorial Calculation
- Calculates the factorial of a given number.
- Includes recursive and iterative solutions.
